Project Description:

This project is a machine learning-based image classification system designed to automatically distinguish between images of dogs and cats. 
Built using Python and deep learning libraries, the system takes an input image and accurately identifies whether it depicts a dog or a cat.

Key Features:

Accepts single or batch image inputs.

Predicts whether each image is of a dog or a cat.

Provides real-time classification results with confidence scores.

Technologies Used:

Python

TensorFlow or PyTorch (whichever you used)

Keras (if used)

OpenCV / Pillow for image processing

NumPy, Matplotlib for data handling and visualization

Jupyter Notebook (for model training and testing)

Streamlit or Tkinter (if you built a UI)

Model Details:

Used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification.

Trained on a large dataset (e.g., Kaggleâ€™s Dogs vs. Cats dataset).

Achieved an accuracy of ~XX% (replace with your actual result).

Included data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.

How It Works:

Preprocesses the input image (resizing, normalization).

Feeds the image into the trained CNN model.

Outputs the predicted class: "Dog" or "Cat".

Possible Enhancements:

Add more classes (e.g., birds, rabbits).

Deploy as a web or mobile app.

Improve accuracy with deeper models like ResNet or EfficientNet
